===================

Visualizing the IOOS Vocabulary terms and their mappings is a key step in making registered vocabs on MMI ORR more useful. This demostration GUI shows how to use the power of SPARQL and dynamic web-page development to allow users to see general to more specific relationships between terms as mapped using simple skos relationships (exactMatch, closeMatch, narrowMatch and broadMatch).
